          <h5>Mr. Damon, how do you define success?</h5>
          <p>
            It’s the work. It’s the process itself. I have done enough movies
            now — movies that have failed, movies that have been successful. All
            we have as the people making it is the love of the doing of it. I am
            aware of the results because I have to be; it has an impact on my
            career so I can’t be ignorant of the movies that I am doing. But
            it’s really about feeling that I did my best work, the best work I
            could do under the circumstances, feeling that we told the story we
            wanted to tell in the way we wanted to tell it. That’s really the
            definition of success.
          </p>

          <h5>So for you it’s about the journey?</h5>
          <p>
            The journey is everything! It’s a cliché, but I have really felt it
            in my own life, in the 25 or 30 years I’ve been in this… The goal is
            the process, really enjoying the process. You can’t really predict
            what is going to happen with movies… I have made movies that I
            thought were really going to be well received and successful, and
            they failed miserably. And I have made movies that were very
            successful that I didn’t see coming.
          </p>

          <h3>
            “It was incredible that we even got the financing to do it because
            these are precisely the types of movies that are going away.”
          </h3>

          <h5>
            Recently you famously admitted to turning down the lead in Avatar
            and losing out on $250 million due to a lucrative backend deal. Is
            that another successful film you didn’t see coming?
          </h5>
          <p>
            (Laughs) I know, I know… The cat is out of the bag on that story. I
            like telling it because it’s the proof that I am the dumbest
            businessman in the world! But really, at the time, I had no choice.
            I would have had to screw over the people working on The Bourne
            Ultimatum and I couldn’t do that ethically. So it’s not like I
            wasn’t doing anything and I just passed on Avatar. That never would
            have happened.
          </p>

          <h5>That’s a small consolation at least!</h5>
          <p>
            Right, at least I can comfort myself with that! (Laughs) But for me,
            the biggest tragedy of that story was that I was missing out on a
            chance to work with James Cameron. He was on top of the list of
            directors that I wanted to work with! When I was talking to him, he
            said that he had only made six movies. And I remember being shocked
            by that. I knew all of his films back to front and it felt like he
            had done much more. He works very infrequently. Now another ten
            years will have gone by before he is doing another one…
          </p>

          <h5>
            For your standards, it’s been a similarly quiet time: you haven’t
            starred in a feature film for a few years. What made you decide to
            take a break from Hollywood?
          </h5>
          <p>
            When I did promotion in Venice in September 2017, I hadn’t worked in
            almost a year. I moved back to Boston because my father was dying.
            That was ongoing… That was September 2016, and he died in December.
            It was a really awful year. I took that year off and I took another
            year off after that. I had done five movies in a row — The Martian,
            Jason Bourne, The Great Wall, Suburbicon and Downsizing all back to
            back — so I had promised my family I was going to take a year off
            but then that year turned into a year in a hospital with my dad,
            which didn’t feel a year off for anybody. So I took another year off
            after that. We really needed to do it, and it was a tough year. We
            were lucky we were able to do it.
          </p>

          <h5>
            Are you seeing the industry differently since taking that time away?
          </h5>
          <p>
            Yeah. The movie business is so different from 20 years ago. The DVD
            market is gone. I was talking to one studio head a few years ago
            that it cut the business in half. Movies like Ford v Ferrari, for
            example, it was incredible that we even got the financing to do it
            because these are precisely the types of movies that are going away.
          </p>

          <h5>What do you mean?</h5>
          <p>
            Well, I remember when we were in Cannes with Behind the Candelabra,
            and I talked to a studio head and asked him why he had passed on it.
            Every studio passed on that movie and we ended up doing it at HBO.
            He said, “It was a $25 million, and then I have to put $25 million
            into P&A. Then I’ve got to split it with an exhibitor, and the
            theater chain is going to get half. So you’ve got to make $100
            million before I get a penny out of that movie; I’ve got to risk 50.
            I love Steven [Soderbergh], Michael [Douglas], and you, but that’s a
            real gamble.” That’s why movies like that are going to TV or they
            are not getting made. All that was happening. That’s another
            perspective shift. It’s just a different business.
          </p>

          <h3>
            “The last few years changed me profoundly, whether I wanted to or
            not.”
          </h3>

          <h5>
            Is it a frightening time to be an actor and a producer — or maybe
            it’s invigorating?
          </h5>
          <p>
            I am very lucky because I have had a really fortunate career. It
            would be frightening if I were 20, 25 years younger and just getting
            into the business because I would be less certain about where it was
            going. But the good news is that a lot of great stuff has just
            migrated to TV and there is wonderful stuff being made on TV, so I
            feel there is going to be work available. It’s just my bread and
            butter movies were movies like this. Those are the kind of movies
            they are not making...
          </p>

          <h5>How are you adapting to this new climate?</h5>
          <p>
            It’s a very interesting time to live in because it’s so much less
            predictable. The last few years changed me profoundly, whether I
            wanted to or not. I still love my job, I still love making movies,
            and I love a lot of different aspects of that. I can definitely see
            directing; I can definitely see writing more in the next decade.
          </p>

          <h5>You would give up acting?</h5>
          <p>
            No, I would still keep acting but ultimately I love filmmaking
            because it speaks to that impulse that we have to tell stories to
            each other. It’s a very human impulse that we have had since we were
            drawing pictures on cave walls, saying, “Hey look, the buffalo
            almost got me. My friends and I got the buffalo instead. Can you
            relate to that?” Film and books and music… Art is the best way to
            tell each other those stories. I still love that. I still feel
            compelled to do it and I don’t know where it is all going. I guess I
            am a little uneasy about it. It’s just something new that puts you
            in a state of unease. The next 20 years are not going to look
            anything like the last 20 years. That much is clear.
